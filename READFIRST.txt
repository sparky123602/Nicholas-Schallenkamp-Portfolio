REQUIREMENTS
    python needs to be downloaded
    Visual Studio Code
    MongoDB must be installed. link: https://fastdl.mongodb.org/windows/mongodb-windows-x86_64-7.0.4-signed.msi

OPEN PROJECT WITH VISUAL STUDIO CODE

SETUP
     1. In menu bar click "View".
     2. Click "Command Palette...".
     3. Search for "Python: Create Environment..." and click on it.
     4. Select "Venv".
     5. Select "Create". Note: might have to select "Delete and Recreate".
     6. Select "Python <version>". Preferably the version is 3.11.7 64-bit (Microsoft Store)
     7. Open a new Terminal. If Powershell is not default, then change the terminal to Powershell.

     8. Make sure you are in the "CSC470" directory. For example, PS C:\project\CSC470>
     9. Run the command: Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process        Note: this should give access to run scripts
     10. Run the command: & <your directory path>/CSC470/.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1               Note: example: & c:/project/CSC470/.venv/Scripts/Activate.ps1
         Now you should see "(.venv)" in front of your PS command line. If not restart the process from step 1. If it doesnt work again google helps.
     
     11. Run the command: pip install flask, flask_login, pymongo
         If the "PROBLEMS" menu in the terminal has any warnings after waiting about more than 20 seconds you have to close and reopen Visual Studio Code.
         AFTER REOPENING YOU WILL HAVE TO REPEAT STEP 9 AND STEP 10 ONLY!

     12. Open MongoDBCompass application on your computer.
     13. Make sure the URL is this: mongodb://localhost:27017. Then click "Connect".
